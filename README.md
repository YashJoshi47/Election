# Online Voting System Using Face Recognition
This project have three levels of security in the voting process. The first level is the verification of Voter ID and password provided by the Election Commission, the second level is the verification of Mobile number using OTP, and third level is face recognition or face matching. The security level of our system is greatly improved by thenew application method for each voter. The user authentication process of the system is improved by adding face recognition in an application that will identify whether the particular user is authenticated or not.
